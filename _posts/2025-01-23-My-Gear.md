This is my gear, as of January 2025.

## Guitars

These are what I have my hands directly on. Artist and instrument. Whether I'm
cranking the amp, relaxing with warm acoustic tones, or fiddling away unplugged,
almost silently on an electric because everyone else is in bed, I love the feel
of a guitar in my hands. From the lusterous finish, to the weight of it, to the
string lines in my fingertips, there's nothing more sublime.

**Epiphone Les Paul Classic** in Worn Purple. This is probably my go to guitar.
The purple is gorgeous. It never fails to get a reaction. When I first started
playing guitar I really wanted a Strat. But somewhere along the way I became a
Les Paul girl.

**Epiphone Casino Coupe** with a classic sunburst finish. I bought this in early
2021 as my first "real" guitar, and I've never regretted it. The build quality
is impecable. Simply amazing for having come out of what many consider to be
an inferior factory. At the time I bought it, size was a particular concern for
me so I went with the coupe rather than the full size Casino. If I were to
replace it, I'd get a full size one. But I do prefer the jack placement on the
coupe. And I highly prefer the fully hollow body over a center block. As Chris
Buck of Friday Fretworks described it, it's a gutsy, slightly unweildy rock and
roll machine. And is it ever.

**Squire Affinity Stratocaster** in Slick Silver. This color is no longer
available, so I feel lucky to have it. I play this probably the least. Every
once in a while I think about getting rid of it, but I tell you nothing plays
like a Stratocaster. The contours are the ultimate in comfort. Even with coil
splitting on my Les Paul, if you want a Stratocaster sound it just can't be
imitated.

**Taylor 214ce-SB DLX** in a Tobacco Sunburst finish. I bought this because
I fell in love with Ellie's guitar from The Last of Us (though in the game it's
a 314). Initially when I bought the Casino I figured a fully hollowbody
electric, when unplugged, would be sufficient for all of my acoustic needs. Not
so. Don't get me wrong, the Casino unplugged is plenty loud for my office. But
it's nowhere near as resonant and beautiful sounding as a true acoustic guitar.

**Höfner Ignition Bass**. This is the low end 500/1 bass. Like the purple
Les Paul, the violin bass never fails to turn heads. When damn near every bass
on the market is only a slight variation on a Precision Bass, this is definitely
going to stand out. People tend to talk shit about Höfners, but fuck the haters.
This thing is rad.

## Amps

I have both a **Positive Grid Spark 40** and **Spark Mini**, though I don't use
them much. I find the presets are on rails and as much as I thought I'd do a lot
of exploring, there are actually too many options and the virtual amps don't
behave the way their inspiration actually behaves.

My main guitar amp is a **Vox Mini Super Beetle**. Again, this is a beautiful
piece of equipment. The amp head is separate from the speaker cabinet and it
looks just like a classic Vox AC100 Super DeLuxe that's been miniturized. After
being a bit disillusioned with the Spark I wanted something with a discrete gain
knob and not just a push button clean/overdrive setting. Being able to dial in
exactly how much distoriton I want is a game changer. Many people swear by tube
amps, but the original Vox Super Beatle used solid state transistors instead of
tubes. It was specifically designed by one of the best transistor engineers
alive to do the design and capture the true Vox sound. The MSB's NuTube
circuitry carries on that tradition.

I also use a **Fender Rumble 40** as a bass amp. The Fender Bassman is the
definitive word on bass amps. There's just nothing else like it. But if you
don't have room for a Bassman and you don't want to deal with tubes, the Rumble
is the next best thing.

## Strings

For electric guitars I've mostly been using **Fender Super 250** .09's. They're
about $5 a set, and I love the way they feel. They're super stretchy for doing
bends, but snap back to their original size so they don't go out of tune.

I've recentely decided to try out some **Ernie Ball Super Slinky Classic** pure
nickel strings. I first put them on my Les Paul, but I'm looking forward to
putting them on the Casino. I'll probably keep Fender strings on the Strat.

For my acoustic I get **D'Addario XS Phsophor Bronze** because they're fully
coated and last longer.

On my base I only use **La Bella Deep Talkin' Bass** flatwounds. Is there any
other kind?

## Misc

Some additional gear I have, in no particular order:

* All Fender cables. I bought a few off-brand cables and they stopped working
  on me. Mostly, a cable is a cable is a cable, so it really comes down to
  reliability. And Fender cables won't let you down.
* **G7th Performance 3 Capo**. The G7th applies equal pressure to all strings,
  is locking, and has one-handed quick-release. Sure, we all have monster grips
  on our fretting hand from playing barre chords, but there's just no need to
  deal with spring action capos.
* **Polytune Clip tuner**. Clip on tuners are much eaier to deal with than
  trying to balance your phone on your knee.
* **GS-1000 Pro+ Guitar Stand**. Having used several different stands, this is
  by far my favorite. It's got a weight activated self-closing yoke that holds
  onto your guitar. It's much more secure than just flopping on a stand and
  it's much easier to deal with than buttoning and unbuttoning the little strap.
  My only complaint is that the shape of the Epiphone Les Paul headstock is at
  just the right angle that it kind of gets wedged in there and it's not as
  easy to remove as my other guitars. Everything else, including the
  violin bass, fit perfectly.
* **D'Addario Humidipak** for maintaining optimum humidity for my acoustic. I
  think I want to get one for my casino as well, since it's fully hollow. It's
  been about 7% humidity during the day recently, so this is a must.
* **Fender 351 celluloid medium guitar picks**. I have probably way too many
  picks. I don't think I'll ever get through them in my lifetime. I've tried
  all kinds materials for picks. For a novice, sure, light nylon picks help a
  lot, but these days I go for the reliability of these. I also find that
  Fender picks have fantastic quality control. I've bought a ton of picks, and
  sometimes I'll get a whole batch of curved picks. It's nuts. I know I can
  count on Fender.
* **Fender 346 Dura-Tone Delrin extra heavy bass picks**. Yeah, I know,
  everybody says that you have to play bass with your fingers and don't use a
  pick. Well if I did what everybody said I wouldn't have a Höfner bass.
  Sometimes a pick, even on a bass is what you need.

## Dream Gear

I mostly have everything I could want. I would love to have a **St. Vincent
signature**, the styling is epic. I also really want to have a **Rickenbacker
325C64**, but they're so damn expensive. I'll probably never even get to hold one,
much less own it.

If anything happened to my Casino Coupe, I'd get a full size Casino. After
getting used to the Taylor, I don't find the size of a casino to be quite so
intimidating.

The one thing I do dream about is getting an upgraded Höfner bass. I'd like an
actual 500/1. Probably a 63 Mersey or an Artist. Ah, be still, my heart.
Considering the amount I've spent on guitars, having one of these as my *one*
bass doesn't seem that unreasonable anymore.

I would also love a Vox AC30 amp head and 2x12 cabinet.
